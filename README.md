# üåê Netpractice

Netpractice is a system administration-related project developed as part of the 42 School curriculum. It consists of 10 exercises where students must configure small-scale networks to communicate with each other, applying concepts learned about TCP/IP addressing.

## üîß Overview

- **Tools**: 42 Intranet Network Simulation Tool
- **Focus**: Understanding and applying networking concepts such as IP addressing, subnetting, and routing
- **Objective**: Configure networks to ensure proper communication between devices

## üìã Exercises

1. **Level 1**: Basic network setup with two devices
2. **Level 2**: Adding a router to connect two networks
3. **Level 3**: Implementing a switch to connect multiple devices
4. **Level 4**: Configuring IP addresses and subnet masks
5. **Level 5**: Setting up routing tables for efficient data transfer
6. **Level 6**: Handling network conflicts and troubleshooting
7. **Level 7**: Implementing VLANs for network segmentation
8. **Level 8**: Configuring DHCP for dynamic IP address allocation
9. **Level 9**: Setting up DNS for domain name resolution
10. **Level 10**: Final project integrating all concepts learned

## üß† Key Concepts Practiced

- **IP Addressing**: Understanding IPv4 addresses and subnetting
- **Routing**: Configuring routers and routing tables for efficient data transfer
- **Switching**: Implementing switches for network segmentation
- **Network Troubleshooting**: Identifying and resolving network issues
- **Network Services**: Configuring services like DHCP and DNS
